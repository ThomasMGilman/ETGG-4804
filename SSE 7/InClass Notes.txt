UnOptimal way:
	1: Pack/ unpack/ twidle chunky pixel -> bit plane
	2: for red plane: cmplt(Reds,{targetVal}), do the same for blue and green
		rP = cmplt(Reds,{redTargetVal})
		gP = cmplt(Greens,{greenTargetVal})
		bP = cmplt(Blues,{blueTargetVal})
		matchingPlanes = rp & gP & bP
		
	3: do same unpacking for cgi plane -> bit plane
		maskRed = CGIr & matchingPlanes
		maskGreen = CGIg & matchingPlanes
		maskBlue = CGIb & matchingPlanes
		
		notMaskRed = not(CGIr & matchingPlanes)
		notMaskGreen = not(CGIg & matchingPlanes)
		notMaskBlue = not(CGIb & matchingPlanes)
		
	unshuffle masks and store image
